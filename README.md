I'm thrilled to share that I've successfully completed the first task of my internship!✨

I've just built a ⌚ Watch Website and a 🍴 Zomato App using UI/UX design principles!

⌚ Watch Website
Product Showcase: Display an elegant collection of watches with detailed descriptions.
Responsive Design: Ensures a seamless browsing experience across all devices.
User-Friendly Navigation: Smooth navigation to enhance user experience.

🍴 Zomato App
Restaurant Listings: Browse through a comprehensive list of restaurants.
Detailed Reviews: Read and write reviews for various dining spots.
User Interface: Clean and intuitive design for easy exploration.

Building these projects has been a fantastic opportunity to enhance my UI/UX design skills and dive deeper into creating engaging and user-friendly interfaces.
